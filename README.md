## World Bank "Women in Parliament" Data

includes the percentage of women in parliament (_"single or lower parliamentary chambers 
only"_) by country (region) and year. It can be downloaded from:

- https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.GEN.PARL.ZS

## Source Data

The data originates from the ["Inter-Parliamentary Union" (IPU)](https://www.ipu.org/)
which provides an *_"Archive of statistical data on the percentage of women in 
national parliaments"_* going back to 1997 on a monthly basis:

- http://archive.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif-arc.htm

The World Bank data is for “single or lower parliamentary chambers only”, while 
the IPU also presents data for “Upper Houses or Senates”. Moreover, the IPU provides 
the actual numbers used to calculate the percentages (which the World Bank does not).
